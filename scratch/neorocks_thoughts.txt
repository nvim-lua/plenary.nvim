# Happy path
neorocks.ensure_installed
-> oh hey, neorocks is setup (does nothing)
-> oh hey, already installed


# Worst path
neorocks.install
-> no hererocks.
    -> wget / curl hererocks
    -> build / install lua & luarocks
    -> OK, I'm done
-> once install is done
    -> build / install the lua package
-> return control flow back?

# First version is, you call install.
# Opens up window
# You see that it's doing stuff
# So you wait (as a person) for it to be done
# Then you require it.

# Second version is, somehow we do this during startup
# But still allow you to complete startup w/out freezing for a long time

# Alternative version:
# Run the install w/ headless nvim
# Could make a script, available in plenary/scripts or something like that, that allows you to do so.
 nvim --headless -c "lua require('plenary.neorocks').install('lua-cjson')" -c "qa"
