# plenary.nvim

All the lua functions I don't want to write twice.

Note that this library is useless outside of Neovim since it requires Neovim functions. It should be usable with any recent version of Neovim though.

At the moment, it is very much in pre-alpha :smile: Expect changes to the way some functions are structured. I'm hoping to finish some document generators to provide better documentation for people to use and consume and then at some point we'll stabilize on a few more stable APIs.

## Installation

```vim
Plug 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim'
```

## Modules

- `plenary.path`
- `plenary.context_manager`
- `plenary.test_harness`
- `plenary.neorocks` (This may move to packer.nvim, but I have added some improvements to use it more as a library.)

### plenary.path

A Lua module that implements a bunch of the things from `pathlib` from Python, so that paths are easy to work with.

### plenary.context_manager

Implements `with` and `open` just like in Python. For example:

```lua
local with = context_manager.with
local open = context_manager.open

local result = with(open("README.md"), function(reader)
  return reader:read()
end)

assert(result == "# plenary.nvim")
```


### plenary.test_harness

Supports (simple) busted-style testing. It implements a mock-ed busted interface, that will allow you to run simple
busted style tests in separate neovim instances.

To run the current spec file in a floating window, you can use the keymap `<Plug>PlenaryTestFile`. For example:

```
nmap <leader>t <Plug>PlenaryTestFile
```

To run a whole directory from the command line, you could do something like:

```
nvim --headless -c 'PlenaryBustedDirectory tests/plenary/ {minimal_init = "tests/minimal_init.vim"}'
```

Where the first argument is the directory you'd like to test. It will search for files with
the pattern `*_spec.lua` and execute them in parallel in separate neovim instances.

The second argument is an optional init.vim to specify so that you can make reproducible tests!

The exit code is 0 when success and 1 when fail, so you can use it easily in a `Makefile`!


NOTE:

So far, the only supported busted items are:

- `describe`
- `it`
- `pending`
- `assert.*` etc. (from luassert, which is bundled)

OTHER NOTE:

We used to support `luaunit` and original `busted` but it turns out it was way too hard and not worthwhile
for the difficulty of getting them setup, particularly on other platforms or in CI. Now, we have a dep free
(or at least, no other installation steps necessary) `busted` implementation that can be used more easily.

Please take a look at the new APIs and make any issues for things that aren't clear. I am happy to fix them
and make it work well :)


### plenary.popup

`popup_*` clone of Vim's commands. If it gets good enough, will submit PR to Neovim and write C wrappers
to provide compatibility layer for Neovim.

Status: WIP

### plenary.window

Window helper functions to wrap some of the more difficult cases. Particularly for floating windows.

Status: WIP

### Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble / things are hanging / other problems:

```
$ export DEBUG_PLENARY=true
```

This will enable debuggin for the plugin.

### plenary.neorocks

Install lua packages with `luarocks`!

Include the following somewhere in your configuration (either heredoc or sourced lua file):

```lua
local neorocks = require("plenary.neorocks")

-- Installs neorocks if necessary and then installs the package you need.
--  Is not synchronous, so should be called from Neovim's command line most likely.
neorocks.install('penlight', 'pl')

-- ensure_installed(package_name, lua_name, headless)
-- Only installs if currently not installed.
--
--   package_name : str             - Name of the package for luarocks
--   lua_name     : (optional) str  - Name of the package that you can require. Used to determine if we have it installed already (not from luarocks)
neorocks.ensure_installed('penlight', 'pl')
neorocks.ensure_installed('lua-cjson', 'cjson')
```

Inspiration: https://github.com/theHamsta/nvim_rocks . However, I've used quite a different end goal (following XDG_CONFIG standards, using `package.path` and `package.cpath` to load the packages and a different strategy of loading).


### Bundled with:

Currently comes bundled with slightly modified versions of:
- luaunit: https://github.com/bluebird75/luaunit -> Used for unit testing
- busted: Unit testing library

### And more to come :)

- [ ] Floating window wrappers
- [ ] Easy border windows to any floating window
